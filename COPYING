I believe this software does not reach threshold of originiality
can is therefore not copyrighted (and cannot be copyrighted), as
it is a minimal program to replace words in a text.

If this is found not to be the case, I decee that it is licensed
under WFTPL.


Misusing that it is public property, to create proprietary pacakges,
will of cause result in me haunting you and all your close relatives
after my death. In the likely event that ghosts are not real, I
would greatly appreciate if you could imaging that you are haunted
by poltergeist.
